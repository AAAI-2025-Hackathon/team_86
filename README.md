# Personalized AI Assistant
This is a Chrome extension that provides real-time, context-aware AI assistance for any website. The AI summarizes articles, explains educational content, fact-checks news, analyzes e-commerce reviews and moreâ€”directly within the user's browsing experience. It works by using a website-category classifier that classifies whether a website is related to education, food, technology, e-commerce, gaming, fitness, news, sports, travel, and social messaging; then, a self-hosted LLM is given a specific prompt (depending on the website category) to guide its response. For example, if the user is in an educational website, the AI can assist them by explaining complex components in the webpage in a simpler manner to make their lives easier.
